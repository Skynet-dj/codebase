1.Review the ./scripts/com_util.project_list() once again
2.If needed create a table(colums: list) function in ./scripts/com_util.py to be used for all table creation
3.the ./scripts/commands/help.py may be removed. General help is not necessery 
    (this program does not run through cmd even loop rather is has its own loop)
4.write the main event loop
    use a try-except block  exceptions--> KeyboardInturrept, 
    commands for terminal should be send to the terminal
5.Improve the ./scripts.help() function
